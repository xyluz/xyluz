### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you!

I am a software developer. I write PHP, JavaScript, Python and do some devOps and Frontend.

Iâ€™m currently working on [zuriboard.com](https://zuriboard.com) (a multitenant LMS currently being used by over 10,000 people across 3 organizations - not commercially available yet).

I am also a trainer, you can view some of my classes on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pE-jTcLXgY&list=PLxuUHF3OiqfWAITD4gPUHZ1GcYRqmyF7P) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoKplElxDLw&list=PLL0ge2KQPI3XA5ed7_Y61EO0pHq1RJUYI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dI_CUlVKrFw&list=PLxuUHF3OiqfVlhMh2XaA7gx_NaavKM7C9), I have a passion for helping complete beginners get started in the tech industry.
